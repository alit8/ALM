# ALM
Active Learning Method for fuzzy modeling

I have implemented Active Learning Method for fuzzy modeling in MATLAB environment. This is just a simple implementation of ALM with Ink Drop Spread (IDS) for finding effective input variables and is not accurate since it considers only one membership function for each input variable.
